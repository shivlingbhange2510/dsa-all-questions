A)What is HTTP ?
The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the foundation of the World Wide Web, and is used to load web
 pages using hypertext links. HTTP is an application layer protocol designed to transfer information 
 between networked devices and runs on top of other layers of the network protocol stack.

 B) What is TCP ?
 TCP is a protocol or standard used to ensure data is successfully delivered from one application 
 or device to another. 
 the Transmission Control Protocol that lies between the Application layer and network layer
  used to provide reliable stream delivery service.
C) Explain all the different HTTP methods?
    a)The PUT method replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload.
    b)PATH : this method used to replace particular object data with given filed;

 D) what is HTTP Header ?
 Http header is a addittional filed in http requeste and  respond that pasess addittional(context) 
 information and meta data regarding request or response .

E) Http respond code ?

200 --> request succeeded.
201 --> new resoure  is created
204 --> There is no content to send for this request, 
205 --> Reset Content

301 -->  (Moved Permanently) The URL of the requested resource has been changed permanently.
302 Found  --> This response code means that the URI of requested resource has been changed temporarily.

400 Bad Request --> you are  response status code indicates that the server cannot or will not process the request 
e.g ) you are hitting api and login with username passoword but there will be might be some syntax issues when 
yoy are sending username, passoword to server (userName:'shiv',,passoword:1234);
here is a syntax error bcs you put ,, after userName this is invalid syntax so that.
eg) server req userName and pass but you only send userName that time it also give 404 err.

401)401 Unauthorized : you are login in website with userName and pass but you are passing incorrect
 userName or pass

due to something that is perceived to be a client error (for example, malformed request syntax, invalid
 request message framing, or deceptive request routing).

 403) Forbidden : in this case you are loged in website and you are try to do something but you dodn't have
 access of this  for this we use this you get this error.
 user access admin routes so you get 
404 Not Found ---> The server can not find the requested resource. this means the URL is not recognized.

403 Forbidden --> client didn't have aceess 0f  this content.
405 Method Not Allowed

500 Internal Server Error. The server has encountered a situation it does not know how to handle.

you hitting 1 api api hits but this hit api call some another api and this other api get down some reson 
that time you will get 500 er.
502) bad getway.
503 ) service unavailable .

504) this is timeout request.
e.g) you are hitting 1 api this API tooks lot of time this case you will get 504 error.

e.g) your website is under maintance and you want did 
501 Not Implemented The request method is not supported by the server and cannot be handled. The only
 methods that servers are required to support (and therefore that must not return this code).

505 HTTP Version Not Supported means whatever whaersion 
client used for make nwk request is not supported for this change HTTPS version

  F) difference between webSocket and Http request ?
    
    a) WebSocket is a bidirectional communication protocol that can send the data from the client to the server
    or from the server to the client by reusing the established connection channel. The connection is kept 
    alive until terminated by either the client or the server.
    a) The HTTP protocol is a unidirectional protocol that works on top of TCP protocol which is a
    connection-oriented transport layer protocol, we can create the connection by using HTTP 
    request methods after getting the response HTTP connection get closed.

    b) Almost all the real-time applications like (trading, monitoring, notification) services use WebSocket
    to receive the data on a single communication channel.
    b) Simple RESTful application uses HTTP protocol which is stateless.

    c) All the frequently updated applications used WebSocket because it is faster than HTTP Connection.
    c) When we do not want to retain a connection for a particular amount of time or reuse the connection for transmitting data; An HTTP connection is slower than WebSockets.

1) what is HTML ?
a) (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and 
structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's 
appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).
 HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, allows web users to create and structure sections, 
paragraphs, and links using elements, tags, and attributes.

 2) what is Hypertext ?
  refers to links that connect web pages to one another, 
 either within a single website or between websites.

 3)What is BEM?
BEM stands for Block, Element, and Modifier. It’s a CSS naming convention for writing cleaner and 
more readable CSS classes.

4) different between display "none" and visibility "hide" ?
The CSS properties for "display" and "visibility" both allow you to hide elements in a page's HTML, 
but they differ in their implications for its appearance and function. Visibility: hidden hides the tag,
 but it still takes up space and affects the page. In contrast, display: none removes the tag and its
 effects for all intents and purposes, but the tag remains visible in the source code. Both approaches 
 are different than simply removing the item(s) in questions
 
 5) Difference between flex and grid  (https://blog.yudiz.com/when-to-use-flex-or-grid/)
The main difference between flex and grid is that flex uses a one dimensional (row or column) 
layout while grid uses a two-dimensional (row and column) layout

5) What is DNS
. A system that stores domain names with its corresponding IP address is known as DNS (Domain name system)

6) what is z-index;
Elements with a bigger z-index will appear in front of the ones with a lower z-index, and if the
 element has a negative z-index it will appear behind non-positioned elements.
  
 7)what is stcking context ?
The stacking context is a three-dimensional conceptualization of HTML elements along an imaginary z-axis
 relative to the user, who is assumed to be facing the viewport or the webpage. HTML elements occupy this 
 space in priority order based on element attributes.

 7)Explain briefly what happens when you hit a url? explain DNS (Domain Name System) lookup (URL – Uniform Resource Locator)

8)Time to First Byte (TTFB) ?
Time to First Byte (TTFB)  refers to the time between the browser requesting a page and when 
it receives the first byte of information from the server.

9)Page loading time
Page loading time (or page loading speed) is the total time necessary for the browser to fully download 
and display the content of a web page, measured in seconds. This parameter is calculated immediately after
 a request is sent from the browser to the web server, and ends when the entire page has been fully 
 displayed on the browser.

 10) What are three ways to reduce page load time?

What are three ways to reduce page load time? Answer: Close. There are many answers here: Reduce image
 sizes, remove unnecessary widgets, HTTP compression, put CSS at the top and script references at the 
 bottom or in external files, reduce lookups, minimize redirects, caching, etc

 11)What do CDN or Content Delivery Networks do? When do you need a CDN?

 A CDN (content delivery network) is a geographically distributed system of servers designed to reduce web 
 loading times. By limiting the physical distance between an end-user and the server, you can deliver 
 content securely and with minimal delay. Every time a user visits your website, the origin server must
 respond and display your content. Without a CDN, all traffic is sent to the origin. In times of heavy 
 traffic, the origin may become overloaded, which can cause your website to respond slowly or even go down.

12 ) Why should I use a CDN? (content delivery network);
Any organization that's concerned about performance, availability, scalability, and security can 
benefit from a CDN. Here are just a few of the benefits of using a CDN:

13)What is a service worker?
A service worker is a type of web worker. It's essentially a JavaScript file that runs separately from
 the main browser thread, intercepting network requests, caching or retrieving resources from the cache,
and delivering push messages.
