2) difference between nodejs Engine Js Engine ?
nodejs and javascript both use v8 engine but they are different in their functionality 
a)JS Engine have DOM manupulation and web APi  it has window as globa; object;
a)nodejs dodn't have DOM manupulation and it didn't have window as global object

b)Another big difference is that in Node.js you control the environment. Unless you are building an open 
source application that anyone can deploy anywhere, you know which version of Node.js you will run the
 application on. Compared to the browser environment, where you don't get the luxury to choose what browser
  your visitors will use, this is very convenient.This means that you can write all the modern ES6-7-8-9 
  JavaScript that your Node.js version supports.

3) what is nodejs Process ?
The process is a global object, an instance of EventEmitter, can be accessed from anywhere.
Node.js provides the facility to get process information such as process id, architecture, platform,
 version, release, uptime,
console.log(`Process Architecture: ${process.arch}`);  
console.log(`Process PID: ${process.pid}`);  
console.log(`Process Platform: ${process.platform}`);  
console.log(`Process Version: ${process.version}`);  

4) what is Node.js
 nodejs is a open source cross platform and runtime environment for developing server side application
