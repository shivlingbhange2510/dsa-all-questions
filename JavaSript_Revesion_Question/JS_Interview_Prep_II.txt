// apply methods

// in this above example make return function but this function is didn't able to accepts parameter
// test obj bcs inside function this keyword pinting to Global object thats window.
// for bind value of test obect with function check we have to bind object with check function;

// CALL METHOD;
//  called method is same as bind only deferrent is call method return value of function where bind method 
// return other function ;


var test = {

      // x();

// apply method is same only deferrent is it accepts arguments as array of parameter



1) What is the difference between readFile and readFileSync?
In fs.readFile() method, we can read a file in a non-blocking asynchronous way, but in fs.readFileSync() 
method, we can read files in a synchronous way, i.e. we are telling node.js to block other parallel
 process and do the current file reading process.


2) difference between nodejs Engine Js Engine ?
nodejs and javascript both use v8 engine but they are different in their functionality 
a)JS Engine have DOM manupulation and web APi  it has window as globa; object;
a)nodejs dodn't have DOM manupulation and it didn't have window as global object

b)Another big difference is that in Node.js you control the environment. Unless you are building an open 
source application that anyone can deploy anywhere, you know which version of Node.js you will run the
 application on. Compared to the browser environment, where you don't get the luxury to choose what browser
  your visitors will use, this is very convenient.This means that you can write all the modern ES6-7-8-9 
  JavaScript that your Node.js version supports.

3) what is nodejs Process ?
The process is a global object, an instance of EventEmitter, can be accessed from anywhere.
Node.js provides the facility to get process information such as process id, architecture, platform,
 version, release, uptime,
console.log(`Process Architecture: ${process.arch}`);  
console.log(`Process PID: ${process.pid}`);  
console.log(`Process Platform: ${process.platform}`);  
console.log(`Process Version: ${process.version}`);  

4) what is Node.js
 nodejs is a open source cross platform and runtime environment for developing server side application
